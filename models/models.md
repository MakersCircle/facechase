## Models used for face detection using dlib
Note: Code where these models are being used are in 'misc'. These models are used in the code made during testing various approaches. In the final product, these models are not used.
1. [dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition_models/blob/master/face_recognition_models/models/dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat)
2. [mmod_human_face_detector.dat](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leeast/mmod-human-face-detector-dat)
3. [shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergiovirahonda/shape-predictor-68-face-landmarksdat)

For some of the scripts in misc folder to work, the above models must be downloaded and placed in this folder.
